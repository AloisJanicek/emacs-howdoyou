#+TITLE: Emacs Howdoyou - A package to search and read stackoverflow and its sisters's sites

[[file:screenshots/howdoyou.png]]

* Intro
This package is inspired by howdoi python and howdoi Emacs package. it searches
your query all accross stackoverflow and it's sisters' sites. They are:
- stackoverflow.com
- stackexchange.com 
- superuser.com
- serverfault.com
- askubunu.com

The result is then showed in an ~org-mode~ buffer. For each result, question and
three answers were showed, but they are collapsed by default except the first
answer. As this package uses Google to get the links, for each query there will
be a dozen of links, the fist link will be used, then use can go to next
link and previous link. The author believes that when searching for solutions it
is important for users to read both questions and answers, so no "quick look"
features such as code only view or code completion are provided.

* Dependencies
~promise~ and ~request~ are required.
User must have ~org-mode~ 9.2 or later installed also.
